# GitLab Continuous Integration (GitLab CI)

![CI/CD pipeline graph](img/cicd_pipeline_infograph.png)

The benefits of Continuous Integration are huge when automation plays an
integral part of your workflow. GitLab comes with built-in Continuous
Integration, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Delivery support to build,
test, and deploy your application.

Here's some info we've gathered to get you started.

## Getting started

The first steps towards your GitLab CI journey.

- [Getting started with GitLab CI](quick_start/README.md)
- [Pipelines and jobs](pipelines.md)
- [Configure a Runner, the application that runs your jobs](runners/README.md)
- **Articles:**

## Reference guides

Once you get familiar with the getting started guides, you'll find yourself
digging into specific reference guides.

- [`.gitlab-ci.yml` reference](yaml/README.md) - Learn all about the ins and
  outs of `.gitlab-ci.yml` definitions
- [CI Variables](variables/README.md) - Learn how to use variables defined in
  your `.gitlab-ci.yml` or secured ones defined in your project's settings
- **The permissions model** - Learn about the access levels a user can have for
  performing certain CI actions
  - [User permissions](../user/permissions.md#gitlab-ci)
  - [Jobs permissions](../user/permissions.md#jobs-permissions)

## GitLab CI + Docker

Leverage the power of Docker to run your CI pipelines.

- [Use Docker images with GitLab Runner](docker/using_docker_images.md)
- [Use CI to build Docker images](docker/using_docker_build.md)
- [CI services (linked Docker containers)](services/README.md)
- **Articles:**
  - [Setting up GitLab Runner For Continuous Integration](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/03/01/gitlab-runner-with-docker/)

## Advanced use

Once you get familiar with the basics of GitLab CI, it's time to dive in and
learn how to leverage its potential even more.

- [Environments and deployments](environments.md) - Separate your jobs into
  environments and use them for different purposes like testing, building and
  deploying
- [Job artifacts](../user/project/pipelines/job_artifacts.md)
- [Git submodules](git_submodules.md) - How to run your CI jobs when Git
  submodules are involved
- [Auto deploy](autodeploy/index.md)
- [Use SSH keys in your build environment](ssh_keys/README.md)
- [Trigger jobs through the GitLab API](triggers/README.md)

## Review Apps

- [Review Apps](review_apps/index.md)
- **Articles:**
  - [Introducing Review Apps](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/11/22/introducing-review-apps/)
  - [Example project that shows how to use Review Apps](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/review-apps-nginx/)

## GitLab CI for GitLab Pages

See the topic on [GitLab Pages](../user/project/pages/index.md).

## Special configuration

You can change the default behavior of GitLab CI in your whole GitLab instance
as well as in each project.

- **Project specific**
  - [CI/CD pipelines settings](../user/project/pipelines/settings.md)
  - [Learn how to enable or disable GitLab CI](enable_or_disable_ci.md)
- **Affecting the whole GitLab instance**
  - [Continuous Integration admin settings](../user/admin_area/settings/continuous_integration.md)

## Examples

>**Note:**
A collection of `.gitlab-ci.yml` files is maintained at the
[GitLab CI Yml project][gitlab-ci-templates].
If your favorite programming language or framework is missing we would love
your help by sending a merge request with a `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

Here is an collection of tutorials and guides on setting up your CI pipeline.
